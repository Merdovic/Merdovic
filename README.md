Mert Osman ÖNDER

About Me:
I am a 9th-grade student at İçel Anadolu High School, focused on advancing my career in Computer Engineering.
My interest in software began in my childhood through repairing computers. At this stage, my primary goal is to become a Backend Developer who designs efficient and scalable systems. I am passionate about quickly adapting to new technologies and focusing on solutions.

Core Skills:
Languages: Basic Python
Currently Learning: Java
Concepts: BackEnd Development
Tools: Git, Windows knowledge, Hardware knowledge.

My Projects:
Project Name: Web Scraping to Extract 10,000 Products from Hepsiburada’s Official Store                                   
This project will help me consolidate my web scraping knowledge, learning how to leverage Python to scrape data from large public databases and write it to an Excel file using the Pandas library.

Technologies Used: Python, Beautiful Soup (BS4), Pandas, Selenium.

Key Achievements: Gained hands-on experience with the data extraction pipeline and significantly enhanced my Debugging and Troubleshooting skills while resolving real-world errors.

Project Name: Console Calculator
A functional four-function calculator was developed to reinforce the fundamentals of Java.

Technologies Used: Java, Scanner.

Key Achievements: Reinforced the concepts of classes, objects, and method invocation. Successfully implemented defensive programming for "Division by Zero" using System.err. Demonstrated robust control flow management (if-else construct) and resource management (Scanner.close()).

Future Goals:
My immediate goal is to complete a software development certification program before starting university, and successfully launch a more complex personal project. After high school, I plan to specialize and deepen my expertise in the Backend Development domain.
