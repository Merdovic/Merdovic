Mert Osman ÖNDER

About Me:
I am a 9th-grade student at İçel Anadolu High School, focused on advancing my career in Computer Engineering.
My interest in software began in my childhood through repairing computers. At this stage, my primary goal is to become a Backend Developer who designs efficient and scalable systems. I am passionate about quickly adapting to new technologies and focusing on solutions.

Core Skills:
Languages: Python
Currently Learning: SQL, JavaScript, Java
Concepts: Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
Tools: Git, Advanced Windows knowledge, Advanced Hardware knowledge.

Current Project:
Project Name: Web Scraping to Extract 10,000 Products from Hepsiburada’s Official Store                                   
This project will help me consolidate my web scraping knowledge, learning how to leverage Python to scrape data from large public databases and write it to an Excel file using the Pandas library. I am currently learning how to store this scraped data efficiently in an SQL database.
Technologies Used: Python, Beautiful Soup (BS4), Pandas, Selenium.
Key Lessons Learned: Gained hands-on experience with the data extraction pipeline and significantly enhanced my Debugging and Troubleshooting skills while resolving real-world errors.

Future Goals:
My immediate goal is to complete a software development certification program before starting university, and successfully launch a more complex personal project. After high school, I plan to specialize and deepen my expertise in the Backend Development domain.
